I’m Alfiia Akhatova. I live in France and I believe that the code can be more beautiful than the French Alps. I came to programming from Physics. In 2017, I defended my PhD on embrittlement of a nuclear reactor material. Immediately after the defense, I became interested in data science and machine learning. Then it seemed to me the first step to artificial intelligence. Oh how far we really are from this! But wait, data science is not just a hype topic, it is a real weapon in the world of business, science and high technology. And I’m going to use it!

I created this blog as a collection of articles and tutorials on data science, machine learning and Python. All materials presented here are made/writen by me. I will be glad if you find them interesting and/or useful.
